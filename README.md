# a micro React app

This is a microscopic React app; it just shows two Counter components, each coming with the value displayed, and 2 buttons to tweak it up or down;

The goals are mostly to

* show the typical folder layout, and give an opportunity to run a React app in development mode with `npm start`
* discover JSX
* and introduce the notion of components

Styling is done in regular CSS, we'll see SASS in another sample React App
